# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)


# account_sid = 'AC3c076ac9ad764ed233de4624370a8b97'
# auth_token = '2b9c570ca4b1fa9e9a68d29f39a08b53'

# 		@client = Twilio::REST::Client.new account_sid, auth_token

# 		from = message.from  
# 		to = message.to
